# Project State

## Current State After Task 007

TCS-Cosheaf is in pre-MVP scaffold state. The repository contains project governance documentation, a short README, a Python-oriented `.gitignore`, the durable documentation skeleton, the minimal Python project scaffold, the initial repository directory layout, initial JSON Schema files, example YAML artifacts, initial Pydantic v2 core artifact models, filesystem-backed storage loading utilities, and initial repository validation gates.

The Python scaffold defines a `cosheaf` package, a Typer-based `cosheaf` CLI entry point, development dependencies, Makefile targets, a Dockerfile for reproducible local development, and smoke tests for import and CLI help/version behavior.

The filesystem layout now includes accepted and draft knowledge-base directories, refuted and obsolete artifact areas, issue directories, experiment directories, and review directories. The initial schemas live under `schemas/`, and examples live under `examples/`.

The core model layer now defines artifact type and status enums, base artifact data models, artifact ID validation, timestamp validation, risk/evidence/review value objects, and pure status/path helper functions.

The storage layer defines `RepoContext`, YAML discovery under `kb/`, `issues/`, and `examples/`, typed YAML loading into `BaseArtifact`, `IssueRecord`, or `ReviewRecord`, repository-relative source paths on loaded records, deterministic ordering by path then ID, clear load errors, and deterministic YAML writing helpers.

The validation CLI now implements repository validation for YAML parse/model parse, ID uniqueness, status/path consistency, dependency existence, accepted-artifact-to-draft-artifact dependencies, and local evidence path existence. Expected validation failures produce concise Rich output and nonzero exit codes without stack traces unless `--debug` is used.

No SQLite storage exists yet. No dependency graph exists yet. No verifier adapters exist yet. No CI configuration exists yet. `cosheaf gate` remains scaffold-only.
